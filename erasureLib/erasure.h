/* It's useful to distinguish diagnostics intended for stderr vs stdout.
   Running 'marfs_fuse -f ... > log 2>&1' allows stderr to go to the log,
   but stdout doesn't get there.  So, one could tweak the PRINTout defn
   here, to send stdout-diagnostics to stderr, then rebuild with
   --enable-debug=all, then rebuild marfs_fuse with --enable-logging=stdout
   --enable-debug, run fuse as suggested above, and see integrated
   diagnostics for fuse and libne in the fuse output log.

   I know it seems odd to suppress stderr-output for the non-debugging
   build, but, otherwise, pftool spews many errors at the user, e.g. when
   underlying libne is failing reads.  This may happen, for example, when
   servers are bottlenecked and communications are timing out, or if a
   server fails, etc.  This kind of output is not something the user wants
   to see, even though from libne's perspective it is a genuine error.
   Probably the best solution is to add PRINTlog(), or something, and have
   the code become conscious of output that really is worth showing to the
   user (for example, command-line help from libneTest).

//       the corresponding function "foo()".  Calling foo() will call
//       foo1() supplying the current-default POSIX uDAL, whereas foo1()
//       can be used by uDAL-savvy callers (like the MarFS RDMA DAL) that
//       know which uDAL they want to use.  This allows utilities written
//       for the NFS-based POSIX uDAL to continue to work over NFS in
//       production, while we validate the functioning of the RDMA uDAL.
//
//       Ultimately, this allows repos using both kinds of uDALs to
//       co-exist, and to be accessed with the same libne build.
//       Theoretically (validated on small scale in practice), it is
//       possible to access objects written with either uDAL, using either
//       uDAL.  However, it seems a big step to drop this assumption into
//       production, without first going through a phase in which old repos
//       continue to be accessed with the NFS uDAL, while new experimental
//       work can be done using the RDMA uDAL.
